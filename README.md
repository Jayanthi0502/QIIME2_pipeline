# Metagenomics Pipeline
- Using QIIME2 to compare the metagenome of healthy individuals vs. patients with Major Depressive Disorder  
- The project ID used was **SRP233274**. It is a publicly available dataset on NCBI:  
  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP233274>  
- The samples were downloaded using ENA Browser Tools on Linux.  

# System Requirements
- **32 GB RAM** for faster PICRUSt2 performance  
- **16 GB RAM** minimum required for QIIME2  
- **PICRUSt2 can run on 16 GB RAM** by decreasing the chunk size
